Hello Foxies, get your hex on with this fun little game to help you learn the hexadecimal colors.  This is a game I built while studying at DigitalCrafts 16 week coding bootcamp. I am hoping to learn every single hexadecimal color by heart! (Kidding, but not) I am kind of obsessed with colors, really, so I thought it only fitting to create a color game.

### Technologies used:
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* Jquery
* Bootstrap

### MVP
To create a simple game that shows a hexadecimal value and 3 color choices.  The user guesses the color and if it matches the hex number, user is a grand prize winner of something amazing, like an animation on the screen, or an invisble ice cream cone.

### Stretch Goals
- [X] graphics 
- [X] levels
- [ ] track points 
- [ ] use SASS 
- [ ] tutorial 
- [ ] Add choice of game, guess by color, or guessing by number 

### Code I enjoyed writing
* function match(color)

### Installation
to run locally:
``` python3 -m http.server 8000 ```
